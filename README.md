## *Weather Dataset Analysis*

**Project Overview:**

This project involves analyzing a weather dataset to uncover patterns and insights into weather conditions. The dataset includes information on precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and weather types recorded over a specific period.

**Key Objectives:**
- ***Data Preparation:*** Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- ***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*** Perform a comprehensive analysis to understand the relationships between weather variables and visualize the data using plots and heatmaps.
- ***Advanced Analysis:*** Apply regression techniques to predict precipitation based on other weather attributes and evaluate model performance.

**Highlights:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Regression analysis to model weather patterns
- Insights and recommendations based on analysis
